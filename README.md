Description:

Specifically, when a user visits the website, they will be greeted by an alert message confirming that they have arrived to the properly deployed site. Next, they will be prompted to enter a number between 8 and 128 characters, depending on how long they would like their password to be. Upon entering that information, they will be asked a series of four questions to confirm if they would like for their password to contain numbers, uppercase or lowercase characters and symbols. Once answered, they will recieve their password and can restart the process again should they prefer a different password.


Goal: 
To create a randomly generated password consiting of uppercase letters/lowercase letters, numbers and symbols using javascript.
